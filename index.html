                    <p>Government’s should make “green” investments to get the economy up and running again as they will create the best financial returns in addition to tackling climate change, economists have said.
                        <span class="content_hidden"><br>In the UK, investment in renewables projects; fitting homes and buildings with extra insulation; improving broadband, and encouraging electric cars and e-bikes could all help kickstart the economy and cut emissions.
                            <br><br>The Covid-19 crisis could mark a turning point in progress on climate change,” the co-authors of the new study wrote.
                            <br><br>Estimates suggest the coronavirus pandemic will trigger an 8 per cent drop in carbon emissions this year due to reduced industrial activity and less use of transportation.
                            <br><br>This remains only just above the 7.6 per cent cuts that scientists say are needed annually in order to ward off the most dangerous effects of global warming.
                            <br><br>The authors of the study - including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern - examined over 700 economic stimulus policies launched during or since the 2008 financial crisis and surveyed 231 experts from 53 countries, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks.
                            <br><br>They found that green projects that reduced emissions consistently created more jobs and delivered higher short-term returns than other measures. 
                            <br><br>For example, building renewables projects or rolling out home insulation refits creates twice as many jobs in the short term per pound spent, compared with fossil fuel investments, and do not run the risk of jobs being moved offshore.
                            <br><br>The study suggests that without strong action, the carbon reductions achieved this year will not last.
                            <br><br>“The Covid-19-initiated emissions reduction could be short-lived,” said lead author Cameron Hepburn, University of Oxford.
                            <br><br>“This report shows we can choose to build back better, keeping many of the recent improvements we’ve seen in cleaner air, returning nature and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.”
                            <br><br>Measures should also include helping industry cut emissions; investing in clean infrastructure, such as public transport; education and retraining for people who might lose jobs in the shift to low carbon, and supporting research and development, the study urged.
                            <br><br>Prof Dave Reay, University of Edinburgh, said: “By aggressive investment in green skills and the creation of a swathe of green economy employment opportunities, the UK can buffer Covid-19’s impacts and simultaneously deliver a safer climate future.”
                            <br><br>Last week, a report claimed that 11,000 deaths have already been avoided across Europe due to improvements in air quality since lockdowns began.

                    <p>Vodafone has launched a heat-detection camera designed to screen people coming into buildings for signs they may be running a fever and potentially be infected with Covid-19.
                        <span class="content_hidden"><br>Each camera can check the temperature of 100 people per minute with thermal images being streamed securely and in real time to a laptop or mobile device.
                            <br><br>If elevated temperatures are detected, alerts are sent to the operator of the camera to help them identify people who may have the infection.
                            <br><br>The camera has been developed by UK-based Digital Barriers, which develops surveillance tech, and is connected through Vodafone’s IoT networking service.
                            <br><br>It incorporates both thermal and HD cameras that deliver real-time body temperature screening accurate to within 0.3°C. Up to eight people at a time can be screened by the camera and it requires less than half a second to assess individual body temperatures.
                            <br><br>Anne Sheehan, business director, Vodafone UK said: “During this crisis, our role has been to keep the UK connected. Now, we want to help UK organisations get their people back to work while prioritising their safety. 
                            <br><br>The heat-detection camera is a helpful tool to support this goal: every organisation needs one. We believe technology-led solutions will play an important role in return-to-work strategies.”
                            <br><br>Vodafone’s chief technology officer Scott Petty said the technology will help to protect front of house staff and employees. “Our IoT network can connect many cameras quickly and without disruption in almost any location,” he said.
                            <br><br>Digital Barriers CEO Zak Doffman said: “This heat-detection camera has been designed to help companies safeguard staff and customers, reopen facilities and get back to work safely. The solution combines class-leading temperature screening with highly secure remote access and alerts.”

                    <p>Researchers have mapped the locations of major renewable energy sites around the world, which will help to provide a better understanding about their environmental impact.
                        <span class="content_hidden"><br>Both solar and wind farms are mapped in the study, allowing people to understand the infrastructure density in different regions and approximate power output.
                            <br><br>The team from the University of Southampton says it is the first ever global, open-access dataset of wind and solar power generating sites.
                            <br><br>With economists saying that green investments are one of the best ways to help countries around begin their post-coronavirus recoveries, understanding where new utilities should be located is essential to minimising environmental impact.
                            <br><br>The estimated share of renewable energy in global electricity generation was more than 26 per cent by the end of 2018 and solar panels and wind turbines are by far the biggest drivers of a rapid increase in renewables.
                            <br><br>“While global land planners are promising more of the planet’s limited space to wind and solar energy, governments are struggling to maintain geospatial information on the rapid expansion of renewables,” said lead researcher Sebastian Dunnett.
                            <br><br>“Most existing studies use land suitability and socio-economic data to estimate the geographical spread of such technologies, but we hope our study will provide more robust publicly available data.”
                            <br><br>While bringing many environmental benefits, solar and wind energy can also have an adverse effect locally on ecology and wildlife.
                            <br><br>The researchers hope that by accurately mapping the development of farms they can provide an insight into the footprint of renewable energy on vulnerable ecosystems and help planners assess such effects.
                            <br><br>The study authors used data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open-access, collaborative global mapping project.
                            <br><br>They extracted grouped data records tagged ‘solar’ or ‘wind’ and then cross-referenced these with select national datasets in order to get a best estimate of power capacity and create their own maps of solar and wind energy sites.
                            <br><br>The data show Europe, North America and East Asia’s dominance of the renewable energy sector, and results correlate extremely well with official independent statistics of the renewable energy capacity of countries.
                            <br><br>Study supervisor Professor Felix Eigenbrod said: “This study represents a real milestone in our understanding of where the global green energy revolution is occurring. It should be an invaluable resource for researchers for years to come, as we have designed it so it can be updated with the latest information at any point to allow for changes in what is a quickly expanding industry.”

                    <p>According to reports, US chipmaker Intel is in advanced stages of talks to acquire the Israeli start-up Moovit, which uses machine learning to provide public transit insights to hundreds of millions of app users.
                        <span class="content_hidden"><br>Moovit offers a free navigation app, which provides transit recommendations – generated by machine learning, using troves of traffic data – to around 800 million users across 102 countries and in 45 languages. The app also integrates with other transportation apps, such as Uber.
                            <br><br>These insights could prove extremely useful for autonomous taxis and other vehicles searching for the most efficient route to their destination.
                            <br><br>In April, Moovit launched a service for transforming vehicle fleets held by transit agencies into an on-demand service to transport key workers safely to their workplaces. The extreme and likely long-lasting impact of the coronavirus pandemic on public transport could present an opportunity for transportation companies to offer on-demand private fleets for business and leisure users which minimise the risk of viral transmission.
                            <br><br>The value of Moovit is unknown, but likely to be well over $500m - its stated value during its most recent funding round in 2018. It has attracted an impressive roster of investors, including Intel Capital, BMW iVentures, Sequoia Capital Israel, NGP Capital, Sound Ventures, Gemini Israel and LVMH.
                            <br><br>The planned acquisition was first reported by Israeli financial news outlet Calcalist, citing “people with knowledge of the talks”. Reports suggest that the deal is very close to being finalised and could be in the region of $1bn, with Israeli newspaper The Marker reporting that 10 per cent of the purchase price is being shared among its 210 employees as a retention package.
                            <br><br>TechCrunch has reported that the start-up will be merged into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub, which is anchored by Mobileye. Mobileye, an autonomous vehicles technology company, was acquired by Intel in 2017 for $15bn - the largest acquisition of an Israeli company to date.
                            <br><br>This automotive hub aims to provide autonomous taxis provided by Volkswagen, fitted using Mobileye vision-based technology and, presumably, supported by Moovit’s real-time traffic insights.
                            <br><br>Intel and Moovit have both declined to comment yet on press queries about the deal.
